# Strapi Authentication in Nuxt.js

This is a step-by-step guide on how to implement Strapi-based authentication in
a Nuxt.js app.

Here's a preview of what we're setting to achieve:

![Preview](./nuxt-strapi-auth-preview.gif)

In essence, authentication is the process through which a website or app
verifies the identity of its users.

As the gatekeeper to an app, authentication needs to be secure and reliable.
After all, it deals with user information, potentially the most critical data in
an app.

Implementing a secure authentication mechanism from scratch is _hard_ and can
quickly become cumbersome. Where do you save the user data? Should you roll out
a database and model the user content type? What about registration, login, and
password reset?

But it doesn't end there. How to securely deal with passwords? Hashing and all
that fun stuff ðŸ˜µ.

That's a lot to think about, when you just want to dive into the core
functionality of the app you're developing!

You could build your own authentication mechanism, but do you really _need_ or
_want_ to? I'd say, better to rely on something that's already built and
thoroughly tested before.

[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is an awesome open source Node.js headless CMS,
backed by a large, [active community](https://strapi.io/community).

One of the cool things about Strapi is that it provides authentication right out
of the box, with built-in admin and user content types and API endpoints to perform the
main authentication operations.

On the frontend, we'll be using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and relying on
Nuxt's [Auth Module](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/), which is the official
zero-boilerplate authentication module for Nuxt.js.

So, in this article, we'll be building two projects:

- Backend: Strapi app to store and manage users
- Frontend: Nuxt app that will use Strapi's API for authentication purposes

The source code for both projects can be found on GitHub:

- [strapi-users](https://github.com/ramigs/strapi-users)
- [nuxt-auth](https://github.com/ramigs/nuxt-auth)

Strapi's authentication scheme is based on email/username and password
credentials, along with JWT tokens. Upon successful authentication, the response
will return a JWT authentication token that will be added to subsequent API
requests. The Auth Module will conveniently help us manage this workflow.

We will also be implementing some basic authorization features, such as
restricting certain pages to only logged in/out users.

This guide builds on top of Chimezie Enyinnaya's [awesome
work](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/implementing-authentication-in-nuxtjs-app),
adapting it to Strapi's specific use case, and adding also the following
features:

- Email confirmation for registration
- Password reset
- Token expiration strategy

I won't go into detailed explanation at every step. Instead, I'll focus on
Strapi and the new functionality. For everything else, I recommend you refer to
[Chimezie's
tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/implementing-authentication-in-nuxtjs-app)
and the [Auth Module documentation](https://auth.nuxtjs.org/#getting-started).

## Pre-requisites

To follow this tutorial, make sure you have Node.js installed:

- Node.js 12.x
- npm 6.x

Although not required, a basic knowledge of Strapi, Nuxt.js, and JWT
fundamentals is recommended.

> Disclaimer: this tutorial was written based on Strapi 3.0.1 (stable release)
> and Nuxt.js 2.12.2. It should work on different versions too, but you may need
> to make some adaptations here and there.

Let's get started!

## Install Strapi

First things first, we begin by creating a Strapi project:

```shell
npx create-strapi-app strapi-users --quickstart
```

We've used the `--quickstart` flag that installs Strapi with default settings.
It also tells Strapi to use SQLite as the database engine and automatically run
our application.

> In our installation, we used the default database, SQLite, because it doesnâ€™t
> require a dedicated database server. Instead, the database is just a single
> file. For the sake of convenience, we'll be using it in this tutorial, but the
> steps in this guide also apply to different database engines.

Once the installation is done, Strapi will automatically be launched in your
browser, asking you to create an administrator account.

To finish the setup and secure your app, go ahead and create a root/admin user,
by filling-in the necessary information:

![Strapi Admin](./strapi-nuxt-admin.png)

From now on, you can access Strapi's local Admin interface by visiting
[http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin).

## Enable email confirmation

By default, the user registration process in Strapi does not include email
confirmation.

To enable it, from the left sidebar of the Admin dashboard, click **Roles &
Permissions**. Select the **Advanced Settings** tab, enable the "Enable email
confirmation" option and save:

![Enable email confirmation Strapi](./strapi-nuxt-enable-email-confirmation.png)

## Email console provider

Thanks to Strapi's Email plugin, we can have a Strapi instance send emails from
our server's local email system or from an external provider (e.g., SendGrid).

Email setup and configuration is not within the scope of this article. We just
want to make sure that the emails are being fired when expected and inspect
their content.

For that, we're going to use
[strapi-provider-email-console](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strapi-provider-email-console),
a Strapi email mock provider used in development, that instead of sending,
outputs the emails to the console.

Stop the Strapi app that's running, navigate to the project's root directory,
and install the email mock provider:

```shell
cd strapi-users
npm install strapi-provider-email-console
```

Once the installation is done, you'll need to add in the provider. Create the
file `./config/plugins.js` and paste the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  email: {
    provider: "console",
  },
});
```

Since we've used `--quickstart` the first time we ran our Strapi app, before
running it in development mode, we need to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Once that's done, start the Strapi app in development mode with the command:

```shell
npm run develop
```

## Create a Nuxt app

Now, let's change gears and focus on the frontend app. It will be a Server-Side
Rendered "Universal" Nuxt.js app.

To get started quickly, open a new terminal and create the project using Nuxt's
scaffolding tool:

```shell
npx create-nuxt-app nuxt-auth
```

Go through the guide and make sure to select following options:

- axios and dotenv in the **Nuxt.js modules** step
- Bulma CSS in the **UI framework** step, which we'll use to style our app

![Create a Nuxt app](./strapi-nuxt-create-nuxt-app-options.png)

Strapi's API URL will vary depending on the environment. So, we want to have it
dynamically loaded from an environment variable.

Once the tool finishes creating the app, edit the `.env` file in the project's
root directory, adding a new environment variable that points to the URL of the
Strapi app that's running locally:

```
API_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:1337
```

Next, navigate to the project's root directory and install the required Nuxt
Auth module dependency:

```shell
cd nuxt-auth
npm install @nuxtjs/auth
```

Once the installation is done, add the module `@nuxtjs/auth` in
`./nuxt.config.js`:

```javascript
modules: [
  // Doc: https://github.com/nuxt-community/modules/tree/master/packages/bulma
  '@nuxtjs/bulma',
  // Doc: https://axios.nuxtjs.org/usage
  '@nuxtjs/axios',
  // Doc: https://github.com/nuxt-community/dotenv-module
  '@nuxtjs/dotenv',
  '@nuxtjs/auth'
],
```

At the top of `nuxt.config.js`, add also the following code to load the
environment variables:

```javascript
require("dotenv").config();
```

One last step we need to do in this file. Configure the base URL that axios will
use when making API requests. In our case, this corresponds to the environment
variable we've added previously:

```javascript
axios: {
  baseURL: process.env.API_AUTH_URL
},
```

## Configure Nuxt Auth

The Auth module uses Vuex's state management to store the user authentication
status and user info.

Enable the Vuex store by creating a file `./store/index.js` with the store
getters:

```javascript
export const getters = {
  isAuthenticated(state) {
    return state.auth.loggedIn;
  },

  loggedInUser(state) {
    return state.auth.user;
  },
};
```

Now we are ready to configure the Auth module. The default, general purpose
authentication scheme - supporting Cookie and JWT login flows - is named
`local`. Let's now map its endpoints with Strapi's authentication endpoints.

Paste the code below into `./nuxt.config.js`:

```javascript
/*
 ** Auth module configuration
 ** See https://auth.nuxtjs.org/schemes/local.html#options
 */
auth: {
  strategies: {
    local: {
      endpoints: {
        login: {
          url: 'auth/local',
          method: 'post',
          propertyName: 'jwt'
        },
        user: {
          url: 'users/me',
          method: 'get',
          propertyName: false
        },
        logout: false
      }
    }
  }
},
```

We've set up two endpoints:

- `login`: authenticates the user. On successful authentication, the JWT token
  will be available in the `jwt` property of the response object.
- `user`: retrieves the authenticated user's info. If the user is authenticated,
  the JWT token will be added to the request, allowing Strapi to identify the
  user. Since the response object is already the user info itself, we set
  `propertyName` to `false`.

We've also disabled the `logout` endpoint, since logging out a user is only done
locally, and doesn't require any request to Strapi's API. The token is simply
removed the from the local storage when the user logs out.

## Navbar Component

Create a file `./components/Navbar.vue` with the following code:

```vue
<template>
  <nav class="navbar" role="navigation" aria-label="main navigation">
    <div class="navbar-brand">
      <nuxt-link class="navbar-item" to="/">Home</nuxt-link>

      <a
        role="button"
        class="navbar-burger burger"
        aria-label="menu"
        aria-expanded="false"
        data-target="navbarBasicExample"
      >
        <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
        <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
      </a>
    </div>

    <div id="navbarBasicExample" class="navbar-menu">
      <div v-if="isAuthenticated" class="navbar-start">
        <div class="navbar-item has-dropdown is-hoverable">
          <a class="navbar-link">
            {{ loggedInUser.username }}
          </a>

          <div class="navbar-dropdown">
            <a class="navbar-item" href="/profile">My Profile</a>
            <hr class="navbar-divider" />
            <a class="navbar-item" @click="logout">Logout</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div v-if="!isAuthenticated" class="navbar-end">
        <div class="navbar-item">
          <div class="buttons">
            <nuxt-link class="button is-primary" to="/register">
              <strong>Register</strong>
            </nuxt-link>
            <nuxt-link class="button is-light" to="/login">
              Log in
            </nuxt-link>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
</template>
```

Let us make the component functional by adding the following `<script></script>`
code:

```vue
<script>
import { mapGetters } from "vuex";

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters(["isAuthenticated", "loggedInUser"]),
  },
  mounted() {
    // Get all "navbar-burger" elements
    const $navbarBurgers = Array.prototype.slice.call(
      document.querySelectorAll(".navbar-burger"),
      0
    );
    // Check if there are any navbar burgers
    if ($navbarBurgers.length > 0) {
      // Add a click event on each of them
      $navbarBurgers.forEach((el) => {
        el.addEventListener("click", () => {
          // Get the target from the "data-target" attribute
          const target = el.dataset.target;
          const $target = document.getElementById(target);
          // Toggle the "is-active" class on both the "navbar-burger" and the "navbar-menu"
          el.classList.toggle("is-active");
          $target.classList.toggle("is-active");
        });
      });
    }
  },
};
</script>
```

We've defined the computed properties `isAuthenticated` and `loggedInUser` used
in the component's template. These are mapped from the previously created store
getters.

The code in the `mounted` hook comes from [Bulma's Navbar
documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/). Its purpose
is to toggle the display of the `navbar-menu` when the `navbar-burger` icon is
clicked.

> The navbar burger menu is displayed on smaller screen sizes.

## Default Layout

Edit `./layouts/default.vue` and replace its content with the following:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Navbar />
    <nuxt />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Navbar from "~/components/Navbar";

export default {
  components: {
    Navbar,
  },
};
</script>
```

## Homepage

Edit `./pages/index.vue` and replace its content with the following:

```vue
<template>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="title">Nuxt Strapi Auth</h1>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>
```

This is what we have so far:

![Nuxt Homepage](./strapi-nuxt-homepage.png)

## Notification Component

Letâ€™s create a Notification component to give feedback to the user.

If everything goes as expected it should display a success message. Otherwise,
an error message should be displayed.

Create a file `./components/Notification.vue` and paste into it the code below:

```vue
<template>
  <div :class="`is-${type}`" class="notification">
    {{ message }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: "Notification",
  props: {
    type: {
      type: String,
      default: "success",
      validator: (val) => ["danger", "success"].includes(val),
    },
    message: {
      type: String,
      default: "",
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

## Register

Create a file `./pages/register.vue` and paste into it the code below:

```vue
<template>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column is-4 is-offset-4">
          <h2 class="title has-text-centered">Register</h2>

          <Notification v-if="success" type="success" :message="success" />
          <Notification v-if="error" type="danger" :message="error" />

          <form v-if="!success" method="post" @submit.prevent="register">
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Username</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="username"
                  type="text"
                  class="input"
                  name="username"
                  required
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Email</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="email"
                  type="email"
                  class="input"
                  name="email"
                  required
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Password</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="password"
                  type="password"
                  class="input"
                  name="password"
                  required
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="control">
              <button type="submit" class="button is-dark is-fullwidth">
                Register
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>

          <div class="has-text-centered" style="margin-top: 20px">
            Already got an account? <nuxt-link to="/login">Login</nuxt-link>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<script>
import Notification from "~/components/Notification";

export default {
  components: {
    Notification,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      username: "",
      email: "",
      password: "",
      success: null,
      error: null,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    async register() {
      this.error = null;
      try {
        this.$axios.setToken(false);
        await this.$axios.post("auth/local/register", {
          username: this.username,
          email: this.email,
          password: this.password,
        });
        this.success = `A confirmation link has been sent to your email account. \
        Please click on the link to complete the registration process.`;
      } catch (e) {
        this.error = e.response.data.message[0].messages[0].message;
      }
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

Before making the request to Strapi's register endpoint, we make sure no token
is added as a request header.

### Redirect after confirmation

Before we can test the register feature, we need to tell Strapi where to
redirect the user after the confirmation link is accessed.

To specify this link, from the left sidebar of the Admin dashboard, click
**Roles & Permissions**. Select the **Advanced Settings** tab, paste
`http://localhost:3000/login` in the "Redirection url" input, and save:

![Strapi Redirect After Confirmation](./strapi-nuxt-redirect-after-confirmation.png)

### Configure Strapi's Server URL

We also need to configure Strapi's public URL. This URL will be used to prefix
the confirmation link that's sent.

Inside the Strapi project root folder, create a `.env` file by copying it from
`.env.example`:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add the `URL` environment variable:

```
URL=http://localhost:1337
```

Edit `./config/server.js` and add the `url` property:

```javascript
url: env("URL", "http://localhost:1337"),
```

> Note that we've set this configuration in the development environment. In
> production, you'll probably want to have SSL, so you'll also need to install
> and configure an upstream proxy application, such as Nginx - and [make Strapi
> aware of
> it](https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/deployment/nginx-proxy.html).

### Testing Register

We're now ready to test the register feature.

Open a new terminal - so that the Strapi app is still running - and run the Nuxt
app in development mode:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/register](http://localhost:3000/register) and
register a user:

![Nuxt Register Page](./strapi-nuxt-register-page.png)

If the registration was successful, a success message is displayed by the
Notification component, requesting that the user completes the registration
process by clicking the confirmation link that was sent:

![Strapi Register Success](./strapi-nuxt-register-success.png)

If an error occurs, the error message is displayed by the Notification component
we've created previously:

![Strapi Register Error](./strapi-nuxt-register-error.png)

Switch to the console where Strapi is running and confirm that you see the
email:

![Strapi Register Email Console](./strapi-nuxt-register-email-console.png)

Copy the confirmation link and access it in your browser. This action completes
the registration but you'll see a "This page could not be found" error in your
browser. That's because we haven't implemented the login page yet.

Let's fix that.

## Login

Create a file `./pages/login.vue` and paste into it the code below:

```vue
<template>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column is-4 is-offset-4">
          <h2 class="title has-text-centered">Log In</h2>

          <Notification v-if="error" type="danger" :message="error" />

          <form method="post" @submit.prevent="login">
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Email</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="email"
                  type="email"
                  class="input"
                  name="email"
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Password</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="password"
                  type="password"
                  class="input"
                  name="password"
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="control">
              <button type="submit" class="button is-dark">
                Log In
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>
          <div style="margin-top: 20px">
            <p>
              Don't have an account?

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

<script>
import Notification from "~/components/Notification";

export default {
  components: {
    Notification,

        });
        this.$router.push("/");
      } catch (e) {
        this.error = e.response.data.message[0].messages[0].message;
      }
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

### Testing Login

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) and login
with a previously registered user:

![Nuxt Login](./strapi-nuxt-login.png)

Notice the changes in the Navbar:

![Nuxt Login Navbar](./strapi-nuxt-login-navbar.png)

## Logout

Let's now add the `logout` method that's triggered when the user clicks the
**Logout** Navbar link.

Edit `./components/Navbar.vue` and add the following code under `mounted()`:

```javascript
methods: {
    async logout() {
      await this.$auth.logout()
    }
  }
```

## User Profile

Time for the user profile page.

Create a file `./pages/profile.vue` with the following code:

```vue
<template>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="title">My Profile</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <strong>Username:</strong>
          {{ loggedInUser.username }}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Email:</strong>
          {{ loggedInUser.email }}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<script>
import { mapGetters } from "vuex";

export default {
  middleware: "auth",
  computed: {
    ...mapGetters(["loggedInUser"]),
  },
};
</script>
```

The `auth` middleware guarantees that only logged in users can access this page.

## Guest middleware

If the user is already logged in, it's probably a good idea to block the access
to the register and login pages.

Create a file `./middleware/guest.js`:

```javascript
export default function ({ store, redirect }) {
  if (store.state.auth.loggedIn) {
    return redirect("/");
  }
}
```

Define the new middleware in `./pages/register.vue` and `./pages/login.vue`:

```javascript
export default {
  middleware: "guest",
};
```

## Password Reset

Let's now implement a password reset mechanism.

This will be achieved with the following workflow:

1. In the **Forgot Password Page**, user submits email.
2. If the email is in Strapi's user database, user receives email with a link to
   the **Reset Password Page** containing a reset code as a URL parameter.
3. User clicks the link and specifies a new password.
4. The new password is sent to Strapi, along with the reset code.
5. The password is updated and the user can now use it to login.

### Forgot Password Page

Create a file `./pages/forgot-password.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column is-4 is-offset-4">
          <h2 class="title has-text-centered">Forgot Password</h2>

          <Notification v-if="success" type="success" :message="success" />
          <Notification v-if="error" type="danger" :message="error" />

          <form v-if="!success" method="post" @submit.prevent="forgotPassword">
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Email</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="email"
                  type="email"
                  class="input"
                  name="email"
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="control">
              <button type="submit" class="button is-dark">
                Email me a reset link
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<script>
import Notification from "~/components/Notification";

export default {
  middleware: "guest",
  components: {
    Notification,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      email: "",
      success: null,
      error: null,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    async forgotPassword() {
      try {
        await this.$axios.post("auth/forgot-password", {
          email: this.email,
        });
        this.error = null;
        this.success = `A reset password link has been sent to your email account. \
        Please click on the link to complete the password reset.`;
      } catch (e) {
        this.error = e.response.data.message[0].messages[0].message;
      }
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

> In our implementation we're disclosing whether the email is registered or not.
> The reason is to show that Strapi gives us that information. However, for

![Nuxt Reset Password Page](./strapi-nuxt-forgot-password-form.png)

The method `forgotPassword` sends a request to Strapi's `auth/forgot-password`
endpoint. If the email address exists in Strapi's user database, an email is
sent with a link to a reset password page in the frontend app.

To specify this link, from the left sidebar of the Admin dashboard, click
**Roles & Permissions**. Select the **Advanced Settings** tab, paste
`http://localhost:3000/reset-password` in the "Reset password page" input, and
save:

![Strapi Reset Password Page Config](./strapi-nuxt-reset-password-page-config.png)

Strapi will attach to it a URL parameter with the code that's required to
successfully reset the user password.

### Reset Password Page

Let's now create the page that will allow the user to define a new password.
Create a file `./pages/reset-password.vue` and paste the following code into it:

```vue
<template>
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column is-4 is-offset-4">
          <h2 class="title has-text-centered">Reset Password</h2>

          <Notification v-if="success" type="success" :message="success" />
          <Notification v-if="error" type="danger" :message="error" />

          <form v-if="!success" method="post" @submit.prevent="resetPassword">
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">New Password</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="password1"
                  type="password"
                  class="input"
                  name="password"
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="field">
              <label class="label">Confirm New Password</label>
              <div class="control">
                <input
                  v-model="password2"
                  type="password"
                  class="input"
                  name="password"
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="control">
              <button type="submit" class="button is-dark">
                Reset Password
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>

<script>
import Notification from "~/components/Notification";

export default {
  middleware: "guest",
  components: {
    Notification,
  },
  asyncData(context) {
    if (!context.route.query.code) context.redirect("/forgot-password");
    else
      return {
        code: context.route.query.code,
      };
  },
  data() {
    return {
      password1: "",
      password2: "",
      success: null,
      error: null,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    async resetPassword() {
      this.error = null;
      if (this.password1 !== this.password2) {
        this.error = "Passwords do not match.";
        return;
      }
      try {
        await this.$axios.post("auth/reset-password", {
          code: this.code,
          password: this.password1,
          passwordConfirmation: this.password2,
        });
        this.success =
          "Password updated successfully. You can now use it to log in to your account.";
      } catch (e) {
        this.error = e.response.data.message[0].messages[0].message;
      }
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

One more thing before we're able to test the password reset feature. We need to
enable the Public Role permission for the `auth/reset-password` endpoint.

To specify this link, from the left sidebar of the Admin dashboard, click
**Roles & Permissions**. Select the **Advanced Settings** tab, paste
`http://localhost:3000/reset-password` in the "Reset password page" input, and
save:

To do so, from the left sidebar of the Admin dashboard, click **Roles &
Permissions**. Click **Public** and under **Permissions** expand the
**USERS-PERMISSIONS** plugin. Under **Auth** check the option "resetpassword"
and save:

![Strapi Reset Password](./strapi-nuxt-reset-password.png)

### Testing Password Reset

Visit `http://localhost:3000/forgot-password` in your browser, fill-in the
"Email" input with an email that has been registered before and click **Email me
a reset link**.

![Strapi Reset Password Email Sent](./strapi-nuxt-reset-password-email-sent.png)

Switch to the terminal where Strapi is running and confirm that the mock email
is there:

![Strapi Reset Password Email Console](./strapi-nuxt-reset-password-email-console.png)

Copy the entire link and access it in your browser:

![Strapi Reset Password Form](./strapi-nuxt-reset-password-form.png)

Fill-in the form and click "Reset Password". This action will reset the user
password:

![Strapi Reset Password Success](./strapi-nuxt-reset-password-success.png)

## Token Expiration

Awesome! We've done a lot, but there's still something missing before we wrap
up.

If the JWT token expires, subsequent requests to Strapi will return a 401
Unauthorized error.

To deal with this, we'll intercept error responses in `axios` and check if the
status code is `401`. If it is, we redirect the user to the login page.

Create a file `./plugins/axios.js`:

```javascript
export default function ({ $axios, redirect }) {
  $axios.onError((error) => {
    const code = parseInt(error.response && error.response.status);
    if (code === 401) redirect("/login");
  });
}
```

In `nuxt.config.js` import the plugin we've just created:

```javascript
plugins: ['~plugins/axios'],
```

Now, when the JWT expires the user will be gracefully redirected to the login page.

## Conclusion

Hopefully you've found this tutorial helpful for implementing Strapi
authentication in your Nuxt app!

You should now have a fully built, ready to be deployed in production
authentication flow, through which users can register, login, and reset their
password.
